    content: `Artificial intelligence has arrived, and it has changed the world forever. Rather than being a single technology with strict boundaries, AI is a vast and dynamic field—one that demands experimentation, creativity, and a thoughtful approach to truly unlock its potential.

Despite its power, AI can often be unpredictable. Getting the right output might require multiple prompts, a shift in perspective, or even an entirely different workflow. That's why using AI effectively—especially in the context of software development—requires more than just knowing the tools. It requires a system.

For this reason, I am have been giving a lot of thought to the implementation of a reliable system and crafted the STANDBOT Method: a practical, quality-first approach to developing websites and web applications with the aid of AI. This method aims to establish a repeatable, efficient workflow that leverages the speed and breadth of AI without compromising on code quality.

## Why the STANDBOT Method?

While many skilled engineers and AI enthusiasts have discovered clever ways to integrate AI into their development workflow, there's still no widely accepted standard for AI-assisted development—especially one that balances speed with quality. The STANDBOT Method is my personal answer to that gap: a system that allows me to build fully functional web applications in about a week, with clean, maintainable code.

Contrary to the belief that "AI doesn't write good code," I believe AI is incredibly moldable. With the right guidance and a structured approach, you can influence how AI writes code and what kind of output it generates. The key is to give it the right context and keep a consistent methodology.

## The Core Philosophy: Quality First

When working with AI, the first priority is avoiding unnecessary feedback loops. Often, trying to fix bugs with AI leads to patchwork solutions that accumulate technical debt. One bug leads to a workaround, then another, and eventually you're left with unstructured code that's hard to maintain.

The STANDBOT Method prevents this by following a "black box" approach:

- You start with a strong, clear prompt that defines exactly what you want.
- You break down the development process into small, manageable steps.
- Each component is built independently, with well-defined inputs and outputs.

This makes AI outputs more predictable and makes it easier to spot errors early—before they cascade through your codebase.

## Real-World AI Workflows

Let's explore how AI can be used in creative, multi-step workflows:

**Traditional Prompt**:
"You are a software developer specialized in web development. Create a futuristic hero section for a landing page of a company that sells vacuum cleaners."

This is one way to start—but different wordings will lead to drastically different results.

**Alternative Approaches**:

- **Design-first**: Create a hero section in Figma, then use an AI-powered tool to generate the corresponding code.
- **Asset-driven**: Use a text-to-image AI to generate visual elements, and provide them to a coding AI for layout integration.
- **Copy-first**: Ask a language model to write compelling copy for your homepage, then guide another AI to design the UI around that text.
- **Brand-guided**: Build a brand book manually or with AI, then feed it as design direction to another AI tool.

The possibilities are endless, limited only by your creativity.

## Standardized Tools for Predictable Outputs

To make the most of AI, standardizing your toolset is crucial. When you use tools that are well-supported, well-documented, and familiar to AI models, your results improve dramatically. My go-to stack looks like this:

**Frontend**:
- Next.js with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for modern, responsive UIs
- Recharts for data visualization
- React Table for complex data tables
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- V0 by Vercel for AI-generated components

**Backend**:
- Supabase as the backend-as-a-service platform

**Languages & Tools**:
- TypeScript and Zod for strong typing and runtime validation
- NextAuth or cookie-based authentication, depending on needs
- React Query for client-side data fetching

This stack is both powerful and AI-friendly. Tools like Next.js and Supabase provide excellent starter templates, enabling you to get up and running fast. You can implement authentication and define your database in a single day, freeing up time to focus on the core functionality of your app.


## Database-First Development

A cornerstone of the STANDBOT Method is starting with the data layer. Once your database schema is defined, everything else—APIs, components, and UI—can be built around it. It provides a solid foundation and helps clarify your application's structure from day one.

## A Practical Workflow: From Idea to Production with AI

Once you've embraced the STANDBOT philosophy, you can begin applying it through a concrete, repeatable workflow. Below is a step-by-step guide to building AI-powered web apps using tools like Supabase, Next.js, and Vercel’s v0. This method is designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure consistent, quality output.

### 1. Start with a Project Definition

Write a clear, concise project definition. This document should answer a single question: *What are you building?* It becomes your source of truth and will serve as the input for your database design.

---

### 2. Generate a Database Schema with AI

Use your preferred LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Grok-3) and feed it this prompt:

\`\`\`
Based on the following document, generate a PostgreSQL database schema compatible with Supabase. It should contain the tables needed to implement the described functionality.

[Your project description goes here]
\`\`\`

---

### 3. Visualize Your Schema

Create 2–4 different schema versions using different prompts or models. Then, import them into [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app):

> New Diagram → PostgreSQL → File → Import → PostgreSQL DDL

Compare the diagrams visually and choose the best one. Supabase allows you to edit later, so just focus on starting with something solid.

---

### 4. Deploy Your Schema in Supabase

Create a Supabase project and paste your selected schema into the SQL editor. Your backend is now live and queryable.

---

### 5. Scaffold the Frontend with Supabase Template

Use the official Supabase + Next.js template to scaffold your app:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
\`\`\`

Follow Supabase’s [Next.js quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs) to configure your API keys. You’ll have cookie-based auth and email verification out of the box.

---

### 6. Type Your Supabase Schema

Add strong typing by generating types:

\`\`\`bash
supabase login
supabase init
supabase link
supabase gen types typescript --linked --schema=public > utils/database.types.ts
\`\`\`

Then wire up typed clients for server and browser contexts using Supabase’s SSR utilities. This enables fully typed access to your database on both client and server.

---

### 7. Generate a Service + React Query Layer with AI

Prompt your AI tool (ideally v0 by Vercel, or other tool that enables the creation of multiple files with one prompt) with:

\`\`\`
This is my database definition:
/utils/database.types.ts

Please generate:
- A service layer with basic CRUD operations, as well as other useful functions that might be needed
- A set of React Query hooks for each table
- A manifest of generated functions for future reference
\`\`\`

Use the following structure in your services and queries:

**Example - Service Layer**

\`\`\`ts
// utils/supabase/services/auditService.ts
export const auditService = {
  getById: async (supabase, id) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from("audit_logs").select("*").eq("log_id", id).single();
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  },
  ...
};
\`\`\`

**Example - React Query Hook**

\`\`\`ts
// hooks/queries/useAuditLog.ts
export const useAuditLog = (logId, ...options) => {
  const supabase = useSupabaseBrowser();
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["audit", logId],
    queryFn: () => auditService.getById(supabase, logId),
    enabled: !!logId,
    ...options,
  });
};
\`\`\`

---

### 8. Generate a Landing Page with v0

Ask v0 to generate a landing page:

\`\`\`
Create a landing page for my project using:
- Color Palette: #1E293B, #4F46E5, #38BDF8
- Fonts: Inter and DM Serif Display
- Style: Clean, modern, trustworthy
\`\`\`

Iterate until the design feels right. Try to get as close as possible to your vision by play with the fonts, colors, structure, and content of your page.

---

### 9. Create a Brand Book

Once the landing page looks great, continue in the same v0 thread:

\`\`\`
Now, create a brand book for this product. Use the same fonts, palette, and tone as the landing page. Include logo usage, color guidelines, typography, and layout principles.
\`\`\`

This helps ensure brand consistency across your app.

---

### 10. Generate the Full Application

Use this prompt:

\`\`\`
Build my application. Here's a manifest of my API/data access layer: [insert manifest].
\`\`\`

Let v0 generate the UI pages and components. Again, don’t aim for perfection—aim for a strong starting point.
Make a few iterations of this process. The aim here is to get a solid starting point, something that you can work with as a base.

---

### 11. Integrate Into Your Project

Download the generated code. Then:

Copy 'tailwind.config.js' and globals.css.\n


### 12. Refactor the first component


We can start with the layout, and build from the bigger to the smaller components.\n
The first thing we want to do is to create a refactoring plan that we can use for the rest of our components.
For this process, we need to be mindful and start by analyzing our application, finding components that can be potentially reused.
We want to start being aware of what our project consists of. This is crucial for us to be able to continue mantaining it. If we rely solely on AI to do everything, we won't be able to understand our project, and we will be lost in the future, unable to scale it.

Our refactoring process will look like this:\n

1. We will create a old-layout.tsx file, and copy the layout code there.\n
2. In layout.tsx, we will refactor the code using our own style and structure, implementing our definition of quality code. For example we can do so by splitting the code into smaller subcomponents. If we would put some of those components in a different file, we can instead create a comment block on top of the component, specifying what its new location would be, for example // move to @/components/Sidebar.tsx.\n
3. Generate a manifest of the component in the top of the file, which we can use later to use it as a black box component for AI.\n
Add a comment block like this:\n

\`\`\`ts
// MANIFEST:
// Exported name: Layout (props) - Renders a responsive UI with sidebar navigation and header.
\`\`\`

4. Now, one by one, we will start moving the components from the fully AI generated version to our own version. We can use AI to help us, providing old-layout.tsx and layout.tsx as a reference of our refactoring strategy.\n

\`\`\`ts
Here is an example of my refactoring strategy:
// old-layout.tsx
  [OLD-LAYOUT CODE]
// layout.tsx
  [NEW-LAYOUT CODE]
I want to refactor this new component:
  [NEW-COMPONENT CODE]
Please refactor it using the same strategy.
\`\`\`

Use this process to create a quality first codebase, using the AI generated code as a base.

---

### 13. Finalize and Refine

Once the scaffolding is in place, it's your turn. You now have:

- A fully typed database
- A complete API/query layer
- A styled and branded frontend
- A reusable component structure

From here, develop like you normally would: test, refactor, and build. AI has handled the boilerplate—now it’s time to add your magic.

---

## Final Thoughts

The STANDBOT Method is not just about building faster—it's about building smarter. It's about embracing AI as a co-developer while maintaining full control over quality, structure, and maintainability.

AI is a tool with infinite potential. But like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how you use it. With the right system in place, you can consistently build high-quality software in record time.

This is my system. It works for me. And maybe—with some tweaking—it can work for you too.`,
